# GitHub Explorer: Pro Edition 🚀

## Project Overview

*GitHub Explorer: Pro Edition* is a modern, full-stack web application built with *React* and *Firebase* Firestore. Its primary purpose is to provide an enhanced interface for searching, discovering, and analyzing GitHub repositories. Users can search for repositories using various filters, *bookmark* their favorites, and attach persistent, real-time-synced *personal notes* to each saved repository.

### Key Technologies

* *Frontend:* React (using useReducer, useCallback, useEffect).
* *Styling:* Tailwind CSS (utility-first classes).
* *State Management:* Built-in **React useReducer** for complex, centralized state logic.
* *Backend & Database:* *Firebase Firestore* (for real-time data sync) and *Firebase Authentication* (Anonymous/Custom Token).
* *Data Source:* GitHub Search API.
* *Icons:* Lucide-React.

## ✨ Features

* *GitHub Repository Search:* Search by keywords, language, and sort by stars, forks, or recent updates.
* *Persistent Bookmarks:* Save favorite repositories to a real-time-synced *Bookmarks* tab using Firestore.
* *Personal Notes:* Attach private, editable notes to bookmarked repositories, with a real-time saving status indicator.
* *Repository Analytics Modal:* A detailed view of a selected repository showing key metrics (Stars, Forks, Issues, Watchers), license, and update date.
* *Debounced Search:* Uses a 600ms debounce on search input to prevent rapid API calls and avoid GitHub rate limiting.
* *Seamless Data Consistency:* Utilizes Firebase's onSnapshot listeners to automatically update the UI whenever bookmarks or notes are modified or saved, even across different sessions or devices.

## 🛠 Setup and Configuration

This application requires a Firebase project to manage user data (bookmarks and notes).

### 1. Prerequisites

* Node.js and npm/yarn.
* A Firebase Project with:
    * *Firestore Database* (configured).
    * *Authentication* (Anonymous Sign-in enabled).

### 2. Required Injected Variables

The application relies on these three variables, which must be injected into the environment or build process where the code is run:

| Variable Name | Description | Data Type |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| __firebase_config | The JSON string of your Firebase project configuration. | string |
| __app_id | A unique string used as a namespace for this application's data within Firestore. | string |
| __initial_auth_token | *Optional.* A custom Firebase token for a pre-authenticated user. If not provided, the app defaults to *Anonymous Sign-In*. | string or undefined |

### 3. Firestore Data Structure

The real-time data is stored under the following path to ensure separation and security based on the authenticated user:
* **/bookmarks:** Stores the full repository object for each bookmarked item.
* **/notes:** Stores the user's personal notes: { content: string, updatedAt: string }.

## 📂 Architecture Highlights

### State Flow (React Reducer)

The core logic uses a single useReducer to manage the entire application state.

1.  *Actions:* All UI interactions dispatch actions (e.g., UPDATE_FILTERS, OPEN_MODAL).
2.  *Reducer:* The appReducer processes the action and returns the new state object.
3.  *UI:* Components re-render based on the new state.

### Data Synchronization

The application follows a *"Read from Firebase, Write to Firebase"* pattern:

* *Reads (Real-time):* The main component uses two useEffect hooks with onSnapshot listeners to establish real-time connections to the /bookmarks and /notes collections.
* *Writes (Actions):* Handlers like handleBookmarkToggle and handleNoteSave directly call Firebase SDK functions (setDoc, deleteDoc). They *do not* update the local state, relying on the real-time listeners to push the database change back to the app, ensuring high data integrity.
